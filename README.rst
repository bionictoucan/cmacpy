The aim of this Python package is to provide general purpose tools to those in CMAC to be able to work with their experimental data in Python.

Current things to be added to the package include:

* Instrument-specific objects to make the loading and working with data in Python easier
* Building blocks for computer vision models (and more generally to deep learning)
* Image analysis tools

Other things can and will be added as time progresses and hopefully at some point we can get people to do feature requests.
